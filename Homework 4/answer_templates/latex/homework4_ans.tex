\textbf{Honor Code } Students may discuss homework problems with peers. However, each student must write down their solutions independently to show they understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by themselves.  Students should clearly mention the names of all the other students with whom they have discussed the homework problems. Using code or solutions obtained from the web is considered an honor code violation. We check all the submissions for plagiarism. We take the honor code seriously and expect students to do the same.
